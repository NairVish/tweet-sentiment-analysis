  Description:
    Abstract: This is a point layer of the U.S. cities that fall within the US basemap data layer and border the Long Island Sound study area.
    Purpose: The purpose of this data layer is to provide a general reference as to locations of the major metropolitan cities and towns that fall within the USA basemap data layer distributed with the Long Island Sound ArcView project file.
